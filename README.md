FUDLib
======
*FUDLibrary - a user defined function library for Interbase 6*

FUDLibrary is an open source library I wrote 15 years ago - my first open source contribution. At the time I intended to develop on the [WindowsNT](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home)/[Interbase](http://www.firebirdsql.org/)/[ACS](http://openacs.org/)/[AOLServer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/aolserver/) stack. Unix was expensive, and Linux and Postgres were immature. However, in order to run this stack I needed to purchase a licence for UDF Library from Mer systems. Rather than purchase a licence, I chose to write an open source clone and add some additional features including soundex searching.

XUnit style unit testing was not yet mainstream, but I did write an extensive acceptance test script in Perl.

Unless you need a GPL C implementation of soundex searching it is probably now only of historical interest.
