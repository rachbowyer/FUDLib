<H2>How to build FUDLibrary</H2>
<BR>
<H3>Windows</H3>
<P>FUDLibrary is available as a Windows binary, but you are welcome to build it from the source code.  To build it you need the Borland C++ v5.5 compiler.
  This compiler is available free from <A HREF="http://www.borland.com">Borland</A>.
  In addition you need a copy of dmake.
  dmake is available from <A HREF="http://www.wticorp.com/dmake/dmake.html">www.wticorp.com</A>.  
A Win32 binary release of dmake was produced by Gurusamy Sarathy and is available from 
<A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/GSAR/dmake-4.1pl1-win32.zip">CPAN</A>. Type, for example,</P> 
<P><CODE>dmake -f makefile.win install</CODE></P><P>to build.<BR>  
The import library supplied for ib_util.dll is not compatible with BC55 so the makefile builds its own import library.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Unix</H3>
FUDLibrary should compile on Linux and other Unix platforms without too many changes. As I don't currently have a Unix machine I am unable to test this. If you do write a Unix makefile please send it to me so I can include it in the next release.
